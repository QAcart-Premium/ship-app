## US-069: Server-Side Rate Recalculation

**As a** system
**I want to** recalculate rates on the server during finalization
**So that** price manipulation is prevented

### Acceptance Criteria

| # | Criterion | Expected Behavior |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Ignore frontend prices | Backend calculates fresh |
| 2 | Validate service | Ensure service exists and handles weight |
| 3 | Apply all rules | Use current pricing configuration |
| 4 | Store calculated rate | Save server-calculated total |
| 5 | Security measure | Prevents users from modifying prices |

### Business Rule

```
On finalization:
1. Receive form data from frontend
2. IGNORE any prices/rates in the request
3. Recalculate using server-side logic
4. Use recalculated rates for storage
5. Return rate breakdown in response
```

### Security Considerations

- Frontend rates are for preview only
- Backend ALWAYS recalculates on finalization
- Price tolerance check (0.01) for validation
- Mismatch logged for security audit

## US-070: Rate Validation on Finalize

**So that** invalid shipments are rejected

### Acceptance Criteria

| # | Criterion | Expected Behavior |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Service must exist | Error if invalid service ID |
| 2 | Weight within limits | Error if weight > service max |
| 3 | Country recognized | Error if unknown country |
| 4 | Calculation succeeds | Error if any calculation fails |

### Error Scenarios

| Scenario | Error Message |
|----------|---------------|
| Invalid service ID | "Service not found" |
| Weight exceeds max | "Weight exceeds maximum for service" |
| Unknown country | "Country not supported" |
| Calculation error | "Unable to calculate shipping rate" |
